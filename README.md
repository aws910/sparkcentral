# sparkcentral
Code challenge for sparkcentral.  Applicant:  Mike Roderick

The strategy for this program was as follows:

1. Create class with constructor

2. Add functions to constructor to ensure no garbage data comes through

3. Perform correct order of operations according to operator

4. Perform the actual arithmatic operations.  This involves first splitting the equation into two parts:  The "before-the-operator" text, and the "after-the-operator" text.  An internal function is called to do the actual mathmatic operations.  After the result has been achieved, simple string splitting and joining are used to re-assemble the equation.

5. Iterate over step 4 until all operations are finished.
